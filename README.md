# Hub Game

> This is a simple hub game made with Custom Tkinter and Turtle

## About the project

The motivation behind this project was to get practice with the python Turtle module and learn some python features such as dataclasses, 
decorators and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Two years, I had the intention to practice OOP. I made a refactor, check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
