## About the project

The motivation behind this project was to get practice with the python Turtle module and learn some python features such as dataclasses, decorators and Object Oriented Programming concepts. Also, I was able to explore the library `PrettyTable` and `customtkinter`.

## Prerequisites

Before to get start the, you must install these tools on your machine:
[GIT](https://git-scm.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (if it's not installed along with python).

## 🎮 Running the game

```bash
# Cloning repository
git clone https://github.com/EngComp-Henrique/Turtle-Racing-Game.git

# Accessing project folder
cd Turtle-Racing-Game

# Installing libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Executing
python3 main.py
```

## 🛠 Tecnologies

The tools used to build this project were:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
