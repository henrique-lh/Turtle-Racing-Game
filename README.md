# üèÅ Turtle Racing Game üèÅ

This project is a game based on the article from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-racing-game-using-python/) with some modifications. In this project you'll be able to bet chips on a color.

cd Turtle-Racing-Game

# Installing libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Executing
python3 main.py
```
