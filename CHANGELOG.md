# Change Log

After two years, I decided to update my turtle race game. This is not just a turtle race game, 
but a hub game, where you can add more games to play.

Also, I applied other programming best practices and SOLID principles I recently studied.
 
### Added - 31/01/2026
 
* Add a new game (Space Invaders) using turtle
* Remove the bet option for the user. The purpose of the hub is to play games!
* Add UV as package and project manager
* Remove unnecessary modules (errors and tests)
* Simplify the code
